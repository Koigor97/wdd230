## Week-01:

Week-01 is about refreshing our Web Dev knowledge since we have been on break for quite a while. So, we are cobwebbing the tech fatigue and imposter syndrome (at least for me 😃) with learning activities that include basic grid layout refactoring the **Holy Grail** layout, and some media-query. Also, we had to dust up our JavaScript knowledge with a codepen exercise.
